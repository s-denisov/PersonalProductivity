# Personal Productivity

This is a productivity app, containing a pomodoro-technique based timer as well as a to-do list. It has been designed 
for personal use and as such is highly opinionated, such as only allowing the user to do tasks that the app believes 
they should be doing.

## The work timer
The app works by automatically scheduling when the user should be working.

If the user is not currently working, then the
this is considered a "Break" and the timer shows the time until the next work session.
