# Personal Productivity

This is a productivity app, containing a pomodoro-technique based timer as well as a to-do list. It has been designed 
for personal use and as such is highly opinionated, such as only allowing the user to do tasks that the app believes 
they should be doing.

## The work timer
The app works by automatically scheduling when the user should be working.

If the user is not currently working, then
this is considered a "Break" and the timer shows the time until the next work session.

In order to make sure the user follows a schedule, they may not start a session after the scheduled time.
To prevent them from simply starting the next session if they miss a session, they may only start
a session up to 5 minutes before the scheduled start time.
